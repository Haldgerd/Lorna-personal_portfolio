# Lorna-personal_portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio and CV presented as an interactive retro-futuristic terminal interface, built with Angular 19. Inspired by the aesthetics of the late 70s, 80s, and early 90s (DOS, Commodore 64, classic sci-fi consoles), it reimagines how a portfolio can look and feel in a digital space.
