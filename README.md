# Angular Retro Portfolio â€“ Terminal Inspired Web CV  

This project is a personal portfolio and CV presented as an **interactive retro-futuristic terminal interface**, built with **Angular 19**.  
Inspired by the aesthetics of the late 70s, 80s, and early 90s (DOS, Commodore 64, sci-fi consoles), it reimagines how a portfolio can look and feel.  

Instead of traditional layouts, the site simulates a **command-line environment** where visitors can type or click commands to explore different sections:  
- `about` â†’ Introduction and background  
- `skills` â†’ Technical and creative toolset  
- `projects` â†’ Selected works, screenshots, and write-ups  
- `contact` â†’ Ways to get in touch  

The goal is to present not only professional experience, but also identity â€” shaped by **curiosity, creativity, and technical exploration**.  

## âœ¨ Features
- **Angular 19** for scalable and maintainable structure  
- **Retro terminal design** with monospace fonts, scanline effects, blinking cursors  
- **Command-driven navigation** for playful exploration  
- **Expandable**: space for GSAP animations, Three.js effects, blog posts, or game-like easter eggs
